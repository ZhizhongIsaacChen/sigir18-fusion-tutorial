# SIGIR 2018 Fusion Tutorial

This is a reposiory for the hands-on part of the tutorial on
fusion for Information Retrieval ran at SIGIR 2018 by Shane
Culpepper and Oren Kurland. 

We provide a walkthrough of how to use the polyfuse tool to 
generate fused TREC runs over systems and multiple query 
variations for the same topic. We also show how to perform a 
simple risk analysis of the resulting runs, as well as perform 
two-tailed t-tests with a Bonferroni correction to test for 
significant differences.

Several other tools are used in this repository. Thanks to 
my Phd students Luke Gallagher, Rodger Benham, Joel Mackenzie,
and Binsheng Liu who helped put together many of these tools, 
as well as Xiaolu Lu, who is a postdoc in the group. Also thanks 
to our visiting PhD student Kevin Roitero who was workin in the 
group when this tutorial was being developed.
